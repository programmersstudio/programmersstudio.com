                        <b>Programmers Studio</b> was founded by Mr. Pulkit Khullar in the year 2018, with the sole motive of changing the world with technology.<br /><br />
                        The idea of flying cars and speaking robots in the future has been on the minds of people in this world. And here, at Programmers Studio, through hard work and determination, we strive to achieve that.<br /><br />
                        Here, at this company, we believe that, “The best way to predict the future is to invent it. ”, as rightly said by Alan Kay.<br /><br />
                        <b>About the Founder:</b><br /><br />
                        Mr. Pulkit Khullar has developed a taste in IT sector ever since his schooling days. When he was still in middle school, his parents bought him a computer,
                         through which, he used  to learn more about his favorite subject. From phones to cars, to medicine, technology touches each and every aspect of our lives, so, if we can create technology, we can change this world. This idea ignited a spark of interest in him, and as a result, he decided to turn his passion into his career.<br /><br />
                         He completed his schooling from Darbari Lal DAV Model School situated in New Delhi, India. He pursued his degree of Bachelor in Computer Applications from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.<br /><br />
                         He is currently working in Tata Consultancy Services from July, 2017 as a System Software Engineer. His job has taught him a lot and has given him the courage to step into this world of freelancing and his zeal &and; zest to do so is what that has made him succeed.<br /><br />
                         <b>A word from the Founder:</b><br /><br />
                         'Hi, I am Pulkit , nice to meet you. I love to design and code things. And I simply love what I do. What I believe is that the thing that interests you the most is what in which you will succeed. My goal is to satisfy all our clients with the best results, for which I’m ready to burn the midnight oil. It is predicted by many, the world will be taken over by Artificial Intelligence by the year 2020.
                          But, AI needs web applications. Our company makes web applications which can later on also be linked with AI. I have been a tech-freak since my school days and I always had this burning desire to delve into each and every aspect of computer, to fill myself with as much knowledge as I can on this topic. I am focused to achieve my aim by providing my clients with a hospitable environment.<br /><br />
                          At the end I\\’d like to sign off by saying that we must never be fearless in pursuit of what sets our soul on fire, in my case, Coding.'
